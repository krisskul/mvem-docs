Introduction
============

**mvem** is a Python package that provides maximum likelihood estimation methods for multivariate probability distributions using 
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Additionally, it includes some functionality for fitting non-Gaussian multivariate mixture 
models. For fitting a wide range of univariate probability distributions, we refer to ``scipy.stats``.

Install
=======

mvem can be installed from PyPI by running ``pip install mvem``. This also installs all requirements and sets everything up.
